# Python Scripts for Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This collection of Python scripts analyzes the accuracy of various project estimation methods (CPM, PERT, BB/2 Mean, Lognormal Mean) against simulated completion times for different probability distributions (Triangular, Lognormal, Beta). The analysis calculates average percent differences between estimated and simulated values across multiple datasets.

## Files

### Core Modules

- **Percent_Difference_Method.py**: Contains the `calculate_percent_differences(filepath)` function. This function reads a CSV file containing simulation results, compares estimation methods against the 'Sim Mean' reference column, and computes the average absolute percent difference for each method. It returns a dictionary of these differences.

- **Overall_Distribution_Per_Diff.py**: Contains the `test_overall_distribution_average_percent_differences(paths)` function. This function takes a list of file paths, calls `calculate_percent_differences` for each, accumulates the results, and returns the overall average differences across all files along with a list of individual file results.

### Distribution-Specific Scripts

- **Triangular_Distribution_Avg_%_Diff.py**: Runs the analysis for Triangular distribution datasets. It defines a list of CSV file paths for Triangular simulation results and computes the overall average percent differences for this distribution.

- **Lognormal_Distribution_Avg_%_Diff.py**: Runs the analysis for Lognormal distribution datasets. It defines a list of CSV file paths for Lognormal simulation results and computes the overall average percent differences for this distribution.

- **BigBeta_Distribution_Avg_%_Diff.py**: Runs the analysis for Beta (BigBeta) distribution datasets. It defines a list of CSV file paths for Beta simulation results and computes the overall average percent differences for this distribution.

### Utility Scripts

- **Individual_File_Stats_Calculator.py**: A standalone script that prompts the user for a single file path and calculates the percent differences for that file using the `Percent_Difference_Method` module. Useful for quick analysis of individual datasets.

- **Combined_Run.py**: A comprehensive script that runs the analysis for all three distributions (Triangular, Lognormal, BigBeta) in sequence. It prints summaries to the console and writes detailed results (overall dictionaries and individual file dictionaries) to `combined_output.txt`.

### Output Files

- **combined_output.txt**: Generated by `Combined_Run.py`, this file contains the complete output data including overall result dictionaries for each distribution and all individual `dict_diff` dictionaries from each file iteration.

- **__pycache__/**: Directory containing compiled Python bytecode files, automatically generated by Python.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Each analysis starts with CSV files containing simulation results. These files have columns for different estimation methods (CPM, PERT, etc.) and a 'Sim Mean' column as the reference.

2. **Percent Difference Calculation**: For each file, the script calculates the absolute percent difference between each estimation method's values and the simulated mean, then averages these differences.

3. **Aggregation**: For a distribution, the script processes multiple files, accumulates the differences, and computes overall averages.

4. **Output**: Results are printed to the console and/or written to files in both human-readable and JSON formats for further analysis.

The scripts use pandas for data manipulation and rely on the file paths being correctly specified in the distribution scripts.

## Results Overview

Running `Combined_Run.py` provides a comprehensive comparison across distributions:

- **Triangular Distribution**: CPM shows the highest error (15.98%), followed by PERT (8.98%). BB/2 Mean and Lognormal Mean perform similarly well (4.31% and 4.42%).

- **Lognormal Distribution**: Similar pattern with CPM at 13.49%, PERT at 6.28%, and BB/2 Mean and Lognormal Mean at 1.56% and 1.59% respectively.

- **BigBeta (Beta) Distribution**: CPM at 9.11%, PERT performs best at 1.54%, with BB/2 Mean and Lognormal Mean at 3.94% and 3.85%.

Overall, PERT and Lognormal Mean tend to provide the most accurate estimates across distributions, while CPM consistently shows the highest percent differences. The Beta distribution yields the lowest errors for most methods, suggesting better estimation performance for this distribution type.
